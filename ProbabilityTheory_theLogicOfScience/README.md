As far as I have read, it is a book enlighting my thought about probability. I am less puzzled after reading a few sections.

## Welcome cooperation.

## NOTE:
This book is not suitable for beginner. And only the experts can read it from beginning to the end. I just read some sections of it. The reviews on Amazon say clear about the book. You can read the beginning sections untill you can understand the material. Or you can read the sections I translated.
